First we retested the 50 SMA  we gap filled  and we retested the last low the spy printed last week of $378.47. I would have preferred that all this retesting and filling to be done during regular trading hours for a concrete confirmation. What we really want to see this morning is confirmation. Confirm  50 SMA ($380.71) and confirm a bounce of that low of $377.99 the market printed in pre-market trading but at a minimum a retest of the 50 SMA if we open above it. To have a semi confirmation we need to hold and take down the first pivot point at a minimum. Let&amp;#39;s see how open before we make any further analysis shall we.

If China actually let it float it would rise insanely fast and wreck their economy.  ..Tesla is selling cars and collecting YUAN that is being converted into USD that are worth less and less and Tesla should be getting 1.5x the conversion but because of the artificial control of YUAN they are getting smoked on this fake conversion.  Materials costs I expect big upticks in as the world reopening along with Chinese massive consumer so that will also raise prices for manufacturing.  I guess we will soon see how they can compete with companies that keep their money in Yuan versus them that converts back into fake USD.
